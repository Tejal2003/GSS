# Scratch Each Other's Back: Incomplete Multi-modal Brain Tumor Segmentation Via Category Aware Group Self-Support Learning


Official implementation of Scratch Each Other's Back: Incomplete Multi-modal Brain Tumor Segmentation Via Category Aware Group Self-Support Learning, ICCV2023.


When GSS is implemented to RFNet, we use the datasets, cuda and pytorch from [RFNet](https://github.com/dyh127/RFNet). Please be sure to follow RFNet's instructions for setting the pypath and cudapath (Must!).
